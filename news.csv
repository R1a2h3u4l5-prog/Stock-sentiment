"AUGUST 08, 2023 / 01:41 PM IST",Buy Cummins; target of Rs 2100 : HDFC Securities,"HDFC Securities' research report on CumminsCummins India Ltd (CIL) recorded the highest-ever revenue of INR 22b (+31%/+15% YoY/QoQ, in line with our estimate). This was driven mainly by strong pre-buy for CPCB 2 gensets. The deadline for the sale of these gensets has been extended until Jul\u201924 (an extension of six months). As a result, CPCB 4+ emission norms will now become effective from 1 Jul\u201924 for gensets with power up to 800kW (CIL has 20% of its portfolio above the 800kW rating). CIL, however, launched the CPCB 4+ compliant products in Jul\u201923 whose prices are 20-50% higher than their older counterpart. In terms of geographical performance, domestic sales have been very robust at INR 16.7bn (+43%/+20% YoY/QoQ). The export market is flattish with a certain part of the world slowing down (Europe, LatAm, APAC). The high HP segment in the export market is robust with 5%/18% YoY/QoQ growth. In CY24, CIL expects to ramp up its manned capacity, which is currently at a utilisation level of 100% as against its installed capacity utilisation of 60-65%. CIL has multiple tailwinds, namely, stringent emission norms, Capex cycle recovery, adoption of alternative fuels with lesser carbon footprint, revival in industrials and supporting manufacturing policies.OutlookWe maintain BUY, with an increased SOTP of INR 2,100 (35x Jun-26 EPS)."

Net sales grew by 26% YoY, with IMFL volumes up 8% YoY to 7.37mn cases. P&A volume/revenue grew by 27/40% (HSIE 15/19%). P&A is sustaining a 9-10% four-year volume CAGR. Regular portfolio volume/revenue fell by 7/5% (HSIE -10/-12%). GM expanded by 300bps QoQ (flat YoY) to 43.6%, well supported by a price hike in country liquor/IMFL and increasing P&A mix, while EBITDAM expanded by 30/300bps YoY/QoQ to 12.6% (HSIE 11%). Radico continues to remain upbeat about exiting FY24 with mid-teen EBITDAM, led by (1) mid-teen P&A volume growth; (2) mid-single digit regular volume growth; (3) price hikes in both country liquor and IMFL; (4) softening RM (glass and ENA expected to remain volatile); and (5) efficiency gains from in-house capacities. Whilst we remain positive about Radico\u2019s success in product innovation and luxury portfolio scale-up, we expect costs related to capex to impact earnings.OutlookWe maintain our EPS estimates and value Radico at 30x P/E on Jun-25 EPS to arrive at a TP of INR 900.

"AUGUST 08, 2023 / 11:50 AM IST",Reduce Orient Electric; target of Rs 230 : HDFC Securities,"HDFC Securities' research report on Orient ElectricOrient Electric\u2019s Q1FY24 performance was a mixed bag as it positively surprised on revenue while continuing to disappoint on margins. Revenue grew 14% YoY, led by 16% growth in the ECD portfolio (Havells ECD grew 5%). ECD growth was broad-based across categories with fans registering 10/16% volume/value growth on improving primary sales. Weak performance in the previous quarters recouped to some extent, with ECD down by 5% during TTM. With the channel inventory of non-rated fans now nearly liquidated, we expect healthy primary fans volume growth in FY24. B2B lighting grew 40% YoY while soft B-C demand and price erosion (lower cost DOB technology) led to lighting growth moderating to 8% YoY. GM expanded by 290bps YoY to 30.7% on a better mix and stable RM basket. Higher employee/other expenses (43/20%) restricted EBITDAM expansion to 10bps at 6.2% (HSIE 7.4%). Orient will continue to invest in long-term strategic initiatives like (1) capability building; (2) branding; (3) distribution; and (4) talent, which shall keep margins under pressure in the near term.OutlookWe cut our FY24-FY26 earnings by 1-4% and value the stock on 28x Jun-25 EPS to arrive at a TP of INR 230. Maintain REDUCE."
"AUGUST 08, 2023 / 11:50 AM IST",Reduce KEC International; target of Rs 511 : HDFC Securities,"HDFC Securities' research report on KEC InternationalKEC reported Q1FY24 numbers with a slightly better EBITDA margin profile. Its revenue/EBITDA/APAT beat our estimates by 8.4%/18.2%/3.4x. However, the standalone PAT margin came in at the lowest level. It won orders worth INR 45bn (i.e. 18% of FY24 guidance of INR 250bn) in FYTD24. With L1 of INR 50bn, the order book (OB) as of Jun\u201923 stood at the record high level of INR 350bn (~2x FY23 revenue). There has been movement in collections from Afghanistan as KEC received INR 2.2bn in FYTD24. The consolidated net debt, including the interestbearing acceptances, stood at INR 57.1bn, an increase of INR 7.3bn from INR 49.9bn as of Mar\u201923, and remains our key concern. The interest cost for Q1FY24 came in at 3.7% (vs. 3.0/2.9% YoY/QoQ) of revenue. The NWC days as of Jun\u201923 stood at 126 and are expected to be ~110 by FY24-end. KEC reiterated its FY24 revenue guidance of INR 200bn (+16% YoY) with the EBITDA margin at ~7%. Given slightly better margins in this quarter, we would like to wait for a few quarters for a clear trend to emerge on the margin profile.OutlookGiven the debt-heavy balance sheet, we maintain REDUCE with an increased TP of INR 511/share (14x Jun-25E EPS, vs. 13x earlier). Our multiple increase reflects improving visibility on margin recovery and the strong bid tender pipeline. Rerating continues to depend upon debt reduction and margin recovery."

Company has a key product launch due in Q2FY24 i.e., of gSpiriva besides other line up of products like Tiotropium, Cyanocobalamin, and Diazepam gel to launch in the short to medium term besides base products sustaining or seeing market share gains in the US. Over the long term, the company intends to build up injectables and biosimilars\u2019 product pipeline to sustain profitable growth over medium to long term. Given its focus on growing profitably across major segments including the US, India, and APIs, we raise its sales growth estimate by 6% and 10% in FY24E and FY25E, respectively. Also, as it proposes to see improved gross margins of Q1FY24 to sustain and the ETR is expected to fall, we increase earnings estimate by 28% and 34% for FY24E and FY25E, respectively.OutlookStock trades at ~ 37.3x/~22.5x its FY2024E/FY2025E revised earnings estimate compared to its historical average 1 year forward PE of 40x it has traded at in the past.

SSSG was weak for both KFC/PH at -0.9/-5% (Sapphire 0/-9%) due to a depressed consumer spending environment.

Revenue/PAT grew by 13%/12%, while OPM rose 20 bps y-o-y to 6.5%. The RAC industry is expected to grow at a slower pace of 10-15% in FY2024 and the company would grow in-line with the industry with EBIT margin of 8.0-8.5%. The company expects better institutional demand for ACs and commercial refrigeration to support growth. Order momentum and inquiries continue to be encouraging in the EMPS segment. The order book stands at Rs. 4,038 crore, up 45.4% y-o-y. The company plans to raise ~Rs. 750 crore through QIP to fund its capex plans for the next 2-3 years, as it believes there is an ample growth opportunities in the domestic as well as export markets such as USA and Europe for its air conditioner business.OutlookWe build in ~17.4%/~34% revenue/PAT CAGR of FY2023-FY2025E.
